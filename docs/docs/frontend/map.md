# Interactive map

## Leaflet

Leaflet is an open-source javascript librery for interactive maps. We followed this [quickstart](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) to add the CDN's to our project public folder, in index.html.

## React-leaflet

The react-leaflet library provides bindings between React and Leaflet. Visit the [documentation](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/start-introduction/) for more information, the docs are great!
