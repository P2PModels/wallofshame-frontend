# Welcome to the Wall of Shame prototype

## Introduction

The Wall of Shame prototype will combine data-activism with the Ethereum blockchain to provide a censorship-resistant dashboard of unpaid invoices from cultural workers.

## The case-study

This prototype will try to tackle a progressive adoption of the web3 technologies. In order to succesfully achive this task three different user profiles have been designed:

1. **Outsider**: in this scenario we encounter a user that wants to use our solution but lacks any knowledge regarding blockchain technology neither has she any intention of getting familiarized with it. She has never used a wallet or any cryptocurrency, she has never heard about a smart contract and she has no intention of learning about it, she just wants to use the website. Therefore the requirements for this scenario is: **Transparent use of web3 technologies through a platform account**. The only ethereum account (EOA) would be the one of P2PModels and it will cover the costs for all the blockchain interactions. As mentioned in [Task assignment in Amara. Prototyping Round Robin with blockchain (I)](https://p2pmodels.eu/task-assignment-in-amara-prototype-round-robin/):

    > The idea behind this component is to cover the costs related to these transactions. We want to spare the users (linguists) this expense, as it could severely affect the user experience and usability of the prototype.

2. **Adopter**: in this scenario we could find a completly nobel user of web3 technologies but interested in learning, or we could find a user with some basic notions about cryptocurrencies and wallets. In both cases, the user prefers a web2 interface but might be interested in some extra info regarding the signer account and recovering it and start using a web3 ui. Therefore the requirements for this scenario is: **Transparent use of web3 technologies with personal account (Ethereum EOA)**. Each user will have its own wallet, with fonds provided by the organization account/using metatransactions, managed by the platform until the user exports it.

3. **Native**: in this scenario the user is completly familiarized with web3 technologies. The platform can be presented as a dApp, requesting user wallet connection, transaction signing, etc. Therefore the requirements are: **Opaque use of web3 technologies through personal account (Ethereum account)** the platform won't have any record about the user.

## Instalation and Setup

### Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

In order to setup and run the front-end open your command-line and run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/p2pmodels/wallofshame-frontend
$ cd wallofshame-frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

A new tab in your default browser should open automatically.

If you want to modify and deploy the a diferent smart contract or subgraph visit the [Wall of Shame backend repo](https://github.com/P2PModels/wallofshame-backend)

## Technology stack

The main frameworks and libraries used in this prototype are:

### Frontend

-   React.js: this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
-   [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/): for UI components.
-   [Ethers.js v5](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/): for web3 interactions.
-   [useDapp](https://usedapp.io): provides useful react hooks for blockchain interactions.
-   [Apollo client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/): to interact with The Graph network and our backend.
-   [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/): as the data transfer layer replacing traditional REST API's.

### Backend

-   [Apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
-   [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): node.js ORM to manage your db.
-   [Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/): Declarative, Code-First GraphQL Schemas for JavaScript/TypeScript
-   [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/): as the data transfer layer replacing traditional API's.
-   [PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): open-source relationtal database.

### Blockchain

-   [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/): blockchain 2.0 network.
-   [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/): programming language for developing smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain.
-   [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): development tools to develope, test and deploy smart contracts.
-   [Waffle](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): testing library for smart contracts.
-   [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/): decentralized service for indexing complex events in the blockchain.

### Deployment

The backend of the project has been containerized using [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Architecrure

<img src="./assets/images/architecture.jpg" width="90%" style="display: inline-block">

At the blockchain level we find the Invoice smart contract, which will serve as the application contract. The task of this contract is to abstract common characteristics of invoices and serve as a registry with permissions, events, status variables, etc.

At the backend level we use an Apollo server with a GraphQL API to make use of a hybrid architecture in which we can implement three different models:

1. Transparent use of blockchain without the option to recover account: The only ethereum account (EOA) would be the one of P2PModels and it will cover the costs for all the blockchain interactions. As mentioned in [Task assignment in Amara. Prototyping Round Robin with blockchain (I)](https://p2pmodels.eu/task-assignment-in-amara-prototype-round-robin/):

    > The idea behind this component is to cover the costs related to these transactions. We want to spare the users (linguists) this expense, as it could severely affect the user experience and usability of the prototype. For the time being, costs will be assumed by a P2P Models Ethereum account, but in the future, an Amara account could be used to handle expenses. Another solution could be a multi-signature account controlled by the linguists themselves.

2. Transparent use of blockchain with the possibility for the user of recovering the EOA and start using the web3 interface.
3. Web3 interface by default: this means the user has to be familiar, or learn it, with the blockchain technology.

In this prototype we are going to test the user experience for each scenario to provide some insights in the usability of web3 services for new users. ~~Therefore, the backend server will be used for handling blockchain logic in scenarios 1 and 2.~~ Â¿? We use Prisma as middleware software to add this resolvers that may interact with ethereum and also to automate the database (PostgresQL) management and improve code quality.

At the frontend level we have a react app with an Apollo client that connects both with the backend API and the graph (GraphQL endpoints) and also to ethereum through
